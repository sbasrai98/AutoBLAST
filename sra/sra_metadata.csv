SRR17589118,GSM5814210: B52 Gw-B844 rep 1; Vitis vinifera; RNA-Seq,,GSM5814210,RNA-Seq,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,cDNA,"VIVE, SVQV, INRAE",,,France,Colmar,Severe stunting symptoms upon nepovirus infection are reminiscent of a chronic hypersensitive-like response in grapevine,"Purpose and strategy: Grapevine fanleaf virus (GFLV) causes variable symptoms in most vineyards worldwide. To better understand GFLV-grapevine interactions in relation to symptom development, field and greenhouse trials were conducted with a grapevine genotype that exhibits distinct symptoms in response to a severe and a mild strain of GFLV. Results: After validation of the infection status of the experimental vines by high throughput sequencing, the transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in plants infected with the two viral strains were tested and compared by RNA-Seq and LC-MS, respectively, in the differentiating grapevine genotype. In vines infected with the severe GFLV strain, 1,023 genes, among which some are implicated in the regulation of the hypersensitive-type response, were specifically de-regulated, and a higher accumulation of resveratrol and phytohormones was observed. Interestingly, some experimental vines restricted the virus to the rootstock and remained symptom-less. Our results suggest that GFLV induces a strain- and cultivar-specific defense reaction similar to a hypersensitive reaction. This type of defense leads to a severe stunting phenotype in some grapevines whereas others are resistant. This work is the first evidence of a hypersensitive-like reaction in grapevine during virus infection.

This study aims to deeply characterize the molecular and physiological changes associated to the onset of ripening through large scale metabolite and gene expression (RNA-sequencing) analyses. Understanding the control of ripening will help developing new vineyard practices to modulate (accelerate or decelerate) ripening in the vineyard.,Vitis vinifera,29760
SRR23252531,Riesling Before Stress Control 2,"Grape berries (seeds removed) were pulverized under liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Total RNA was extracted from three biological replicates, each replicate comprised of homogenate of 6 berries each, using a modified DEPC-CTAB protocol (Gasic et al., 2004), with three technical replicates performed for each biological replicate at the Before Stress, During Stress, and After Stress time points. RNA was quality-checked on an agarose gel and was quantified using a Nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Following quality validation and quantification using a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Agilent Bioanalyzer (Santa Clara, CA, USA), cDNA libraries were prepared from the RNA and sequenced by BGI Genomics (Hong Kong, China) on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform as 2150 paired-end reads.",BS-7C,RNA-Seq,TRANSCRIPTOMIC,cDNA,Texas A&M University,USA,College Station,USA,College Station,Grape heat and water stress RNAseq,"Recurring heat and drought episodes present challenges to the sustainability of grape production worldwide. We investigated the impacts of heat and drought stress on transcriptomic and metabolic responses of berries from two wine grape varieties. Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling grapevines were subjected to one of four treatments during early fruit ripening: 1) drought stress only, 2) heat stress only, 3) simultaneous drought and heat stress, 4) no drought or heat stress (control). Berry metabolites, especially organic acids, were analyzed, and time-course transcriptome analysis was performed on samples before, during, and after the stress episode. Both alone and in conjunction with water stress, heat stress had a much more significant impact on berry organic acid content, pH, and titratable acidity than water stress. This observation contrasts with previous reports for leaves, which responded more strongly to water stress, indicating that grape berries display a distinct, organ-specific response to environmental stresses. Consistent with the metabolic changes, the global transcriptomic analysis revealed that heat stress had a more significant impact on gene expression in grape berries than water stress in both varieties. The differentially expressed genes were those associated with the tricarboxylic acid cycle and glyoxylate cycle, mitochondrial electron transport and alternative respiration, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, carbohydrate allocation, ascorbate metabolism, and abiotic stress signaling pathways. Knowledge regarding how environmental stresses, alone and in combination, impact the berry metabolism of different grape varieties will form the basis for developing recommendations for climate change mitigation strategies and genetic improvement.",Vitis vinifera,29760

Most of the elite cultivated grapevine varieties (Vitis vinifera L.) are grafted on conventional rootstocks but they are becoming more and more affected by climate changes, particularly the increase of salinity. Tunisia has important wild grapevine (V.vinifera ssp. sylvestris) populations among which certain genotypes displayed enhanced tolerance to salinity when compared with conventional rootstocks. Thus, the present project will focus on the search for key regulators involved in salt tolerance from Tunisian wild grapevine accession (Tebaba) using RNAseq technology. This is not only crucial to understand their resistance mechanisms to salt stress, but also the identified molecular markers could be used for an innovative molecular breeding strategy. Consequently, expected findings will be useful to develop new generation of grapevine rootstocks more resilient to global climate change and therefore to promote sustainable viticulture.",Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris,755351
